Identicon
=========

This project was a fun attempt to reverse engineer how identicons are algorithmically created. My discoveries lead to a presentation at a local JavaScript meetup.

If you are looking for a rockin' identicon generator, I would recommend looking to [Blockies.js](https://github.com/download13/blockies)
